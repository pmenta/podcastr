# Projeto

This is a project developed during the Next Level Week, presented by @Rocketseat.

Podcastr is an application for Rocketseat's FalaDev podcast. We have the player that has looping, shuffling playlist, forward in the list and back functionality.

We use Next.js to generate the pages statically. The home is statically generated and the episodes pages are generated as static dynamic pages, pages that are not statically generated at build time, but as soon as someone enters the page and it makes requests, the page is stored as static.

I went further and implemented:

- Dark Mode
- Theme Switcher
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Used techs:

- React
- Next.js
- SASS
- JSON Server
- Libs:
  - rc-slider
  - date-fns
  - next-pwa
